In 2001-2008, he worked as a PhD student first and an assistant researcher later to develop the saltwater intrusion modeling system in the Changjiang River Estuary. During this period, he reconstructed the framework and I/O rules of the ocean model ECOM-si and introduced the wet/dry and adaptive time-stepping methods. This model has been widely used in the applied and scientific researches till now. Since 2009, he built a Yellow and East China Seas modeling system, created the advection algorithm HSIMT, and developed the de-tiding survey method PAMS. With these new tools and methods, he studied systematically the behavior and dynamics of river plume and coastal currents under a tidal environment.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"21e072ff74132af098b01c03d3d79f2f","permalink":"https://pong-tamu.github.io/authors/hui/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/hui/","section":"authors","summary":"Hui works on estuarine and coastal dynamics, with observational and modelling methods.

In high school I also started playing lacrosse, which I played all through high school and college and hope to pick up again soon. Running has been a part of my life since about 1998. I've run numerous half marathons, and completed my first marathon in October 2006 (Marine Corps) and second marathon in April 2009 (Big Sur).
