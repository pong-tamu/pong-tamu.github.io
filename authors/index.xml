      <description>&lt;p&gt;People in the Physical Oceanography Numerical Group work on problems in the coastal ocean using numerical simulations. Currently, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.myroms.org/&#34;&gt;Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)&lt;/a&gt; is used for all of the simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dylan received his B.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of Maine in 2019. During his undergrad, he worked on several coastal engineering projects, including: 1) Assessing the viability of vegetation farms as a solution to coastal erosion in southern Maine, 2) Performing field work for the Sensing Storm Surge Project, which implemented a citizen science network to study storm surge in several Maine estuaries, and 3) Conducting laboratory experiments to study the hydrodynamic and turbulent characteristics of floating oyster cages. He was also an NSF REU student during summer 2018 at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, where he used ROMS outputs to study salinity structure in Copano Bay, an unsteady estuary along the Gulf Coast. After joining PONG in January 2020, his research focuses on the SUNRISE NSF-NERC project, which aims to understand the influence of near-inertial and submesoscale motions on turbulent mixing in the upper ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hui works on estuarine and coastal dynamics, with observational and modelling methods. In 2001-2008, he worked as a PhD student first and an assistant researcher later to develop the saltwater intrusion modeling system in the Changjiang River Estuary. During this period, he reconstructed the framework and I/O rules of the ocean model ECOM-si and introduced the wet/dry and adaptive time-stepping methods. This model has been widely used in the applied and scientific researches till now. Since 2009, he built a Yellow and East China Seas modeling system, created the advection algorithm HSIMT, and developed the de-tiding survey method PAMS. With these new tools and methods, he studied systematically the behavior and dynamics of river plume and coastal currents under a tidal environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Seattle, but headed east of the mountains to attend &lt;a href=&#34;www.whitman.edu&#34;&gt;Whitman College&lt;/a&gt;, where I received a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and minor in mathematics in 2005. After college, I lived in Washington, D.C., for most of a year before returning to Seattle to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;www.washington.edu&#34;&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt; in my hometown. I received a Masters of Science in &lt;a href=&#34;amath.washington.edu&#34;&gt;Applied Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; in June 2007, and a Ph.D. in &lt;a href=&#34;me.washington.edu&#34;&gt;Mechanical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; in June 2012. I am currently an Assistant Research Professor in &lt;a href=&#34;ocean.tamu.edu&#34;&gt;Oceanography&lt;/a&gt; at Texas A&amp;amp;M University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of academics, I have always been active in the outdoors. I began climbing mountains when I was 15 and have been doing so ever since. In high school I also started playing lacrosse, which I played all through high school and college and hope to pick up again soon. Running has been a part of my life since about 1998. I&amp;rsquo;ve run numerous half marathons, and completed my first marathon in October 2006 (Marine Corps) and second marathon in April 2009 (Big Sur). I also try to participate in an ultra run once a year somewhere around the West Coast with some good friends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a coastal physical oceanographer specializing in submesoscale (0.1-10 km) processes with an interest in interdisciplinary research linking fluid dynamics to biogeochemistry in the coastal environment. I am also a big fan of turbulent and mixing processes in coastal zones. I use a hierarchy of ocean modeling tools, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.myroms.org/&#34;&gt;ROMS&lt;/a&gt; (RANS), &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/johnryantaylor/DIABLO&#34;&gt;DIABLO&lt;/a&gt; (LES), &lt;a href=&#34;http://dedalus-project.org/&#34;&gt;DEDALUS&lt;/a&gt; (CFD solver in spectral methods), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gotm.net/&#34;&gt;GOTM&lt;/a&gt; (turbulence model), to combine with theories to explore coastal oceans. I received my Ph.D. in oceanography under the supervision of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/hetlandrobert.html&#34;&gt;Prof. Robert Hetland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tamu.edu/&#34;&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; and currently work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://profiles.stanford.edu/leif-thomas&#34;&gt;Prof. Leif Thomas&lt;/a&gt; as a postdoctoral research fellow at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stanford.edu/&#34;&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rob Hetland is a Professor in the Dept of Oceanography, Texas A&amp;amp;M University. His research is focused on numerical simulation of flow in estuarine, coastal, and continental shelf environments; applications include examining plankton bloom dynamics, formation and destruction of continental shelf hypoxia, and real-time surface current forecasting.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Veronica received her bachelor degree in Oceanography from ESPOL University in Ecuador, and then she attended Gent University in Belgium for her masters degree (2003). For many years her research focused on sandy beach benthos ecosystems in Ecuador, spending her time between field work and multivariate statistical analysis. In 2012 she started working at the Oceanographic Research Institute of the Ecuadorian Navy (INOCAR), were here career path changed. As part of the development of an integrated early warning system for the Ecuadorian coast, she participated in the implementation of a forecast system based on ocean numerical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrilled by the potential of numerical models, and how they can be used to better understand the dynamics of complex ecological systems, Veronica is back in grad school as a Ph.D student, joining PONG in September 2014.
